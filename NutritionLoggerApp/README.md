My nutrition app allows you to enter the food you consume, and keep track of nutritional value.
Anyone can benefit from this app as it motivates you to eat nutritious meals and be healthier.
My app is interesting because it allows you to compare your nutrition per day with the recommended amounts.
You can even add new food items, that are not already in the app, and their nutritional values.

## User Stories
- Create new food items and add them to today's log
- See which nutrients (and how much) still needs to be consumed today
